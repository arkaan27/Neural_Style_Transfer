# Neural_Style_Transfer

This Neural Network uses VGG19 architecture to compute a Generated image. Inputs include a Content Image and Style Image. This model consists of 2 parameters to which it can be analyzed. Style Cost and Content Cost which both sums up to the Total cost of the NN. 

# Frameworks

It primarily uses tensorflow, numpy and scipy.
